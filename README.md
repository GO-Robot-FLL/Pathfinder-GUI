# Welcome to Pathfinder 

We developed this solution for the **First Lego League** competition.
It's a GUI that quickly converts paths on the map into Python code for our Spike Prime robot.


# Requirements
1. Pathfinder-GUI was made with **Python 3.12.0**. 

    Make sure to install the newest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Pygame and Numpy with pip:

    ```
    pip install pygame
    pip install numpy
    ```


# Usage 

How to start the GUI:

1. Clone repo from our **GitHub**

2. Run "main.py" file

## Buttons
- **Output**: Prints the code for the selected path to the console
- **Clear Map**: Clears all paths 
- **Right / Left**: Sets the starting point for the current path to the right or left Start Zone

## Create a single path
Just click on the map to add points. The shortest path between them is added automatically.

## Create multiple paths
Use the Number Keys 1 - 6 select a new path with a different color.
